# Security Policy

## Supported versions

This is a small utility project without formal versioned releases. Security fixes are applied on `main`.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do **not** post security vulnerabilities publicly in issues.

Instead, report by opening a private communication channel with the maintainer (for example, via GitHub profile contact options), and include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested mitigation (if known)

We will acknowledge reports and work on a fix as quickly as possible.
