# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We want this project to be a welcoming, respectful space for everyone.

Participants are expected to:

- Be respectful and constructive
- Assume good intent
- Focus feedback on ideas, not people
- Avoid harassment, insults, or discrimination

## Values

People of all identities are welcome here. Trans rights are human rights.

## Unacceptable behavior

Examples include:

- Harassment or personal attacks
- Hateful, discriminatory, or demeaning language
- Trolling, intimidation, or sustained disruption
- Publishing private information without consent

## Enforcement

Project maintainers may remove, edit, or reject comments, issues, commits, or pull requests that violate this Code of Conduct.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, open an issue in this repository with context and screenshots if relevant.

Maintainers will review reports and respond as promptly as possible. This is a small one-person project, so response time may vary.
