Participants are expected to:

- Be respectful and constructive
- Assume good intent

- Avoid harassment, insults, or discrimination

## TRANS RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS ##
        - END OF DISCUSSION

## Unacceptable behavior

Examples include:

- Harassment or personal attacks
- Hateful, discriminatory, or demeaning language
- Trolling, intimidation, or sustained disruption
- Publishing private information without consent

## Enforcement

Project maintainers may remove, edit, or reject comments, issues, commits, or pull requests that violate this Code of Conduct.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, open an issue in this repository with context and screenshots if relevant.

Maintainers will review reports and respond as promptly as possible. But realistically I am just one person so...
